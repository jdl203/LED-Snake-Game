# LED-Snake-Game
Play the classic game Snake on a 16x32 LED matrix display! This project involved my high school final project where I developed Snake in PyGame from scratch. This python file was developed to communicate data over multiple serial ports to external Arduinos. The controller Arduino has a simple 4 button circuit to control the direction of the snake, while the other Arduino handles displaying the game on the LED matrix. The flow of data is as follows: Controller Arduino (Reads inputs, sends data over serial) -> Python Snake Game (Reads the direction from serial, Game Logic, sends data over serial with pixel information) -> Screen Driver Arduino (Reads data of pixels, drives the LED matrix).
